%DRAWLINEINMATRIX Draw line in 2D matrix.
%   M = DRAWLINEINMATRIX(M, POINT1, POINT2) draws a line in the matrix M,
%   in which the elements crossed by the line are set to '1'. All other
%   elements are left unchanged.
%
%   The coordinates of the points are given as (X, Y) pairs, NOT (I, J).
